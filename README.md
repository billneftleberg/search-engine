# Secure Search Engine

This project is a secure and professional JavaScript-based search engine for websites, designed to provide a seamless user experience.

## Features

- **HTML Frontend**: Clean and formal interface for search input and results display.
- **CSS Styling**: Professional and responsive design for a polished look.
- **JavaScript Functionality**: Secure and efficient search logic using client-side scripts.
- **JSON Dataset**: Example data to simulate search functionality.
- **Confirmation Notification**: Visual feedback on successful search completion.

## Files Included

1. `index.html`: The main HTML file for the search engine interface.
2. `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the interface.
3. `scripts.js`: JavaScript logic for search functionality and notifications.
4. `data.json`: Example JSON dataset used for search.

## Installation

1. **Download the package** and extract its contents.
2. Place the files in your web server's document root (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to use the search engine.

## Usage

1. Enter a keyword into the search box and click the "Search" button.
2. Results will display below the search bar, listing matching entries from the dataset.
3. A confirmation message will appear after a successful search.

## Customization

- Replace `data.json` with your own JSON file to include custom search data.
- Update `styles.css` to modify the design as needed.
- Adjust `scripts.js` to implement additional functionality.

## Notes

- Ensure the server supports static file serving for `data.json`.
- For production use, consider securing the data with server-side logic.
